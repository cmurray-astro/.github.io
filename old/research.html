<p> Galaxy evolution is driven by where, when and how stars form. In particular, the flow of material through the interstellar medium (ISM) -- from diffuse plasma to molecular, star-forming clouds -- is crucial. For my thesis, I use sensitive radio observations of neutral hydrogen (HI) and molecular gas to trace this flow in the Galactic and Magellanic ISM. </p>

						<h2>21-SPONGE</h2>
					</header>

					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/vla2.jpg" alt="" /></span> I am a leading member of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/evla21sponge/">21-SPONGE</a> ("21-cm Spectral Line Observations of Neutral Gas with the VLA", P.I. S. Stanimirovic), the largest, most sensitive survey of Galactic HI absorption at the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA; pictured left) to date (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...804...89M">Murray et al. 2015a</a>). Constraining physical properties of HI is essential to understanding its role in star formation, and 21-SPONGE is uniquely able to detect HI over its full range of density (n ~ 0.01-100 cm<sup>-3</sup>) and temperature (T~10-10<sup>4</sup> K). At UW-Madison, I have managed all observations, data reduction and analysis for 21-SPONGE (over 500 VLA hours). To minimize observing overheads, I showed that combining calibrator observations in time improves noise levels dramatically, and also characterized a 60 kHz "ripple" in the VLA bandpass caused by finite impulse response filters. </p>
					<p>Although analytical models predict two thermally-stable phases of HI: the cold neutral medium (CNM; T~50-200 K), and warm neutral medium (WNM; T~2000-4000 K), we do not detect much WNM despite our high sensitivity. To improve sensitivity further, I developed a stacking method for our absorption spectra, and detected a WNM feature at high significance with  Ts=7200(+1800,-1200) K (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...781L..41M">Murray et al. 2014</a>). This temperature is higher than expected, and provides new evidence that Lyman-alpha scattering may be important for HI excitation. Understanding these excitation mechanisms is crucial to disentangling astrophysical effects from HI signals at all redshifts, and our study is among the first constraints from local observations. </p>

					<p>In early 2015, we published the first half of the 21-SPONGE survey (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...804...89M">Murray et al. 2015a</a>), and found excellent agreement between our results and both previous observations and recent ISM simulations. In addition, we applied the same analysis to HI spectra from the Perseus molecular cloud to probe the cold-gas structure of Galactic molecular clouds and the role of optically-thick HI to the total gas content (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...793..132S">Stanimirovic, Murray et al. 2014</a>, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...809...56L">Lee, Stanimirovic, Murray et al. 2015</a>). Furthermore, our HI temperature measurements helped to diagnose the role of turbulence in Perseus (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...811L..28B">Burkhart, Lee, Murray et al. 2015</a>).</p>


					<p>Concurrently, our group developed an automatic method to decompose spectra into Gaussian functions using derivative spectroscopy and machine learning techniques (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AJ....149..138L">Lindner, Vera-Ciro, Murray et al. 2015</a>). I will use this method to compare 1000's of simulated HI spectra with the full 21-SPONGE survey and produce benchmarks for how well simulations can reproduce HI observations (Murray et al.2016, in prep). </p>

						<h2>"Dark" Molecular Gas</h2>
					</header>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/atca.jpg" alt="" /></span>Stars form in molecular clouds composed largely of molecular hydrogen (H2). As H2 does not emit readily in conditions typical for molecular clouds, carbon monoxide (CO) is used as a popular indirect tracer of H2. However, observations of low-metallicity galaxies show that a large amount of H2 in cloud envelopes is not well traced by CO. This ``CO-dark" molecular gas is traced well by HCO+ absorption in the Milky Way, providing a new way to estimate the H2 mass and compare atomic and moelcular gas tracers along the same line of sight. As the PI, I observed HCO+ absorption in the Magellanic System (MS) with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA; pictured right). Low metallicities in the MS make it an exciting laboratory for molecule formation. As a result, I published the first detection of HCO+ absorption in the MS (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...808...41M">Murray et al. 2015b</a>), and led a follow-up campaign to observe HI absorption and understand the role of HI in molecule formation in this extreme environment (Murray et al. 2015c, in prep). I am also the PI of an Atacama Large Mm/Sub-mm Array (ALMA) proposal to probe molecule formation with HCO+ absorption in Galactic high velocity clouds. </p>

						<h2>Methanol Masers in M31</h2>
					</header>
					<p>As a summer student at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO, Socorro) in 2010, I worked with Dr. Lorant Sjouwerman to reduce VLA and EVLA data from a blind survey for 6.7 GHz methanol masers in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). We detected a single bright maser in the disk of M31, which is the first methanol maser (or maser of any kind) to be found in the galaxy. This and other higher-frequency masers are good candidates for proper motion studies of M31. (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...724L.158S">Sjouwerman et al. 2010</a>). </p>
